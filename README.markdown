The *Programming Languages Zoo*, or *PL Zoo* for short, implements
a variety of programming languages. The implementations are purposely
kept simple and to the point so that they are a good starting point
for those who would like to implement their own programming language,
or just learn how it is done.

The PL Zoo is open source, see the file `LICENSE.txt` for licensing information.

## Prerequisites

To compile the PL Zoo you will need:

* [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org/) programming language, version 4 or later,
* [menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/) parser generator.

A good way to get started with OCaml is to use the [Ocaml Package
Manager](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/), through which menhir is available.

## WARNING

At the moment the PL Zoo is undergoing a major reorganization. I am porting it to Github
and consolidating the various programming languages into a more unified library. Please
stay tuned.
